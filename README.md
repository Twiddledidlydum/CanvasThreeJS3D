===============

This is a Canvas 3D project done as part of a video tutorial into basic rendering and physics. The tutorial can be found at

The goal was to create surfaces and a bounding box for a ball that would bounce off the walls using basic rectilinear
physics, reversing on whatever axis of the object (x,y,z) encountered the obstacle.
